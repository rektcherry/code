This program will generate user-specified number of random names.
Replace output_nmbr with the amount of names you want to create and replace the delimiter with any delimiter you need. The output is stored in array called output.

FILES:

Code contains three main parts.
1. textfile.txt contains dictionary of english words. It is just a default setting to see this actually works. It can be replaced with anything to better suit user needs. 
2. config.js creates 3 arrays of names and fills them with words from textfile using variable step as the step lenght to go through the text file. 
3. index.js takes randomly 1 word from each array and combines them to create a new random name.

To run program >> run index.js file
